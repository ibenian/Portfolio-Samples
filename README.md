Some code examples from my coding projects

###GroundWarLogic.cs
Functional asynchrounous game programming sample based on my Rx based game engine.

###EntityQueryLanguage
EQL (Entity Query Language) is a fluent API that I've developed to write SQL queries in a strongly typed fashion
against an object model and execute it against various different databases.  Unlike other ORMs,
EQL supports much of the T-SQL and PL-SQL languages.  Many ORM frameworks aim to completely 
isolate database access by abstracting a common subset of the query languages, while EQL starts with
the database and provides a bridge to OO world with a much richer query language.
